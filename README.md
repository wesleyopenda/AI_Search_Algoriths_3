# Greedy best first search and A* algorithms.
## Introduction

This readme file is about my experience in writing code for the greedy best first search (GBFS) and the A* algorithm for the first time. I will discuss the approach I took, the challenges I faced, and the resources I used to write the code.

## Approach

I started by reading about the greedy best first search and the A* algorithm in various online sources such as websites and blogs. This helped me to understand the concepts of these algorithms and how they differ from each other.

After getting a clear understanding of these algorithms, I started writing the code in Python. I started with GBFS and implemented the code step by step, testing it at every stage to make sure it was working correctly.

Once I had completed the GBFS code, I moved on to the A* algorithm. I followed the same approach, writing the code step by step, testing it along the way.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced while writing the code was understanding the concepts of these algorithms. It took me some time to get a clear understanding of how these algorithms work and how to implement them in code.

Another challenge was testing the code. I had to make sure that the code was working correctly, and I had to test it with various examples to be sure.

## Resources

The following resources helped me in writing the code for GBFS and the A* algorithm:

* Online websites and blogs that explain the concepts of these algorithms.
* Seeking help from my Uni instructors.
* Python documentation, which provided me with the necessary information on how to write the code in Python.

## Conclusion

Overall, it was a great experience writing code for GBFS and the A* algorithm for the first time. It was challenging, but I learned a lot and I am proud of the code I wrote. I am confident that I will be able to write code for these algorithms in the future with more ease.
